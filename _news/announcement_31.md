We have released <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10372">UniMed</a>, an open-source and large-scale multi-modal medical dataset comprising 6 diverse medical modalities. Building upon UniMed, we train UniMed-CLIP, a family of strong medical VLMs. Dataset, models and demos <a href="https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/UniMed-CLIP">are available here.</a>
