Hi, I am Muhammad Uzair, a PhD candidate at <a href="https://vilab.epfl.ch/">VILAB</a> at EPFL supervised by <a href="https://vilab.epfl.ch/zamir/">Prof. Amir Zamir</a> and <a href="https://federicotombari.github.io/">PD. Dr. Federico Tombari</a>. Previously, I completed my MSc in Computer Vision at the [IVAL](https://www.ival-mbzuai.com/) lab at Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), where I was kindly supervised by [Dr. Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/) and [Dr. Fahad Khan](https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home?pli=1&authuser=1). I am also grateful to be co-supervised and mentored by [Dr. Muzammal Naseer](https://muzammal-naseer.netlify.app/).

My research focus is on adapting foundational multi-modal models for vision tasks including image recognition, object detection and video action recognition. The goal is to steer these foundational models for downstream tasks with limited data (few-/zero-shot) while maintaining their pre-trained generalization for novel tasks. 

<b> Currently, I am </b> focusing on scaling up Multi-task foundational models and Complex Video Reasoning using Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs).
